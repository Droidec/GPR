README for the GPR library
==========================

GPR is a multi-tool C library project, open source and free to use. The goal
is to offer common functionnalities such as date manipulation, network
management and log writing. It gathers diversified features in a single,
easy to use, library.

Project content:
================

doc/ . . . . . . Library documentation
extras/  . . . . Extra features for development
include/ . . . . Header files
lib/ . . . . . . Library files
models/  . . . . Models for development
obj/ . . . . . . Object files
src/ . . . . . . Source files
tests/ . . . . . Unitary tests

Build & Installation:
=====================

Simply run the following commands:
- make
- make install

Required package(s):
- gcc (C compiler)
- make (Makefile)

Makefile Usage:
===============

Use the "make (all)" utility to compile the dynamic library.
Use the "make install" utility to install dynamic library on your Unix system (in /usr/local/)
Use the "make uninstall" utility to uninstall dynamic library from your Unix system.
Use the "make graph" utility to graph library/modules dependencies. (Python3/Graphviz package required)
Use the "make doc" utility to generate documentation (Doxygen package required)
Use the "make test" utility to compile unit tests functions.
Use the "make indent" utility to auto indent headers, sources and unit tests files. (clang-format package required)
Use the "make clean" utility to clean local dynamic library, object files and unit tests.
Use the "make cleangraph" utility to clean graph files
Use the "make cleandoc" utility to clean documentation
Use the "make clear" to clean everything

Development:
============

Required/recommended package(s):
- clang-format (>= 11.0.0) (Auto indent C/C++/Objective-C code tool)
- doxygen (>=1.9.0) (Auto documentation generation tool)
- graphviz (>= 2.44.1) (Set of graph drawing tools)
- python3 (>= 3.6) (High-level programming language)
- valgrind (Memory debugging tool)

Add/modify a module:
- Read HOW-TO-DEV text file
- Refer to the models/ section if needed
- Add/enhance include/ and src/
- Add/enhance test/ section with new features, test retrocompatibility and memory leaks
- Auto indent with "make indent"
- Update documentation with "make doc"
- Write changes in CHANGELOG for future version

Improve a module:
- Check "// TODO" or "// WARN" markers regularly
