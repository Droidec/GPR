README for the GPR library
==========================

GPR is a multi-tool C library project, open source and free to use. The goal
is to offer common functionnalities such as date manipulation, network
management and log writing. It gathers diversified features in a single,
easy to use, library.

Project content:
================

doc/             - Auto-documentation generation
extras/          - Extra features to help development
include/         - Header files
lib/             - Library files
models/          - Model files
obj/             - Object files
src/             - Source code
tests/           - Unitary tests

Required/Recommended package(s):
================================

- vim (Light text editor for git utilities)
- gcc (GNU project C compiler)
- clang-format (C files indentation)
- make (GNU make utility for Makefile)
- graphviz (Set of graph drawing tools)
- valgrind (Memory leaks)

Usage:
======

Use the "make (all)" utility to compile the dynamic library.
Use the "make install" utility with sudo privilege to install dynamic library on a Linux system.
Use the "make uninstall" utility with sudo privilege to uninstall dynamic library from your Linux system.
Use the "make graph" utility to graph dynamic library dependencies.
Use the "make test" utility to compile unit tests functions.
Use the "make indent" utility to auto indent headers, sources and unit tests files.
Use the "make clean" utility to clean local dynamic library, object files, unit tests and extra stuff.

Development:
============

=> Add/enhance a module
- Read coding rules in the doc/ section
- Refer to the models/ section if needed
- Update the inclusion levels in the doc/ section if needed
- Generate a new dependencies graph with the "make graph" utility if needed
- Add/enhance test/ section with new features, test retrocompatibility and memory leaks
- Auto indent project
- Write changes in CHANGELOG
