README for the GPR library
==========================

GPR is a multi-tool C library project, open source and free to use. The goal
is to offer common functionnalities such as date manipulation, network
management and log writing. It gathers diversified features in a single,
easy to use, library.

Project content:
================

doc/ . . . . . . - Library documentation
extras/  . . . . - Extra features for development
include/ . . . . - Header files
lib/ . . . . . . - Library files
models/  . . . . - Models for development
obj/ . . . . . . - Object files
src/ . . . . . . - Source files
tests/ . . . . . - Unitary tests

Build & Installation:
=====================

Run the following commands:
- make
- make install

Required package(s):
- gcc (GNU project C compiler)
- make (GNU make utility for Makefile)

Makefile Usage:
===============

Use the "make (all)" utility to compile the dynamic library.
Use the "make install" utility to install dynamic library on your Unix system.
Use the "make uninstall" utility to uninstall dynamic library from your Unix system.
Use the "make graph" utility to graph library/modules dependencies. (Python3/Graphviz package required)
Use the "make test" utility to compile unit tests functions.
Use the "make indent" utility to auto indent headers, sources and unit tests files. (clang-format package required)
Use the "make clean" utility to clean local dynamic library, object files, unit tests and extras stuff.

Development:
============

Required/recommended package(s):
- clang-format (>= 11.0.0) (Auto indent C/C++/Objective-C code tool)
- graphviz (>= 2.44.1) (Set of graph drawing tools)
- python3 (>= 3.6) (High-level programming language)
- valgrind (Memory debugging tool)

Add/modify a module:
- Read coding rules in the doc/ section
- Refer to the models/ section if needed
- Update the inclusion levels in the doc/ section if needed
- Add/enhance test/ section with new features, test retrocompatibility and memory leaks
- Auto indent with "make indent"
- Write changes in CHANGELOG

Improve a module:
- Check "// TODO" or "// WARN" markers regularly
