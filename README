README for the GPR library
==========================

GPR is a multi-tool C library project, open source and free to use. The goal
is to offer common functionnalities such as date manipulation, network
management and log writing. It gathers diversified features in a single,
easy to use, library.

Project content:
================

extras/  . . . . Extra features for development
include/ . . . . Header files
models/  . . . . Models for development
src/ . . . . . . Source files
tests/ . . . . . Unitary tests

Build & Installation:
=====================

Required package(s):
- cmake (Cross-platform build process tool)

Build & install API:
- mkdir build
- cd build
- cmake ..
- make
- make install

Build & install API (Debug):
- mkdir build
- cd build
- cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG ..
- make
- make install

API Usage:
==========

You can include a GPR module in your source code as follows:
#include <GPR/module.h>

Make sure to link GPR library at compile time with:
- "-lGPR" for the shared version
- "-lGPR_static" for the static version

Makefile Usage:
===============

Use the "make (all) (GPR) (GPR_static)" utility to build API
Use the "make doc" utility to generate API documentation (doxygen/graphviz package required)
Use the "make graph" utility to graph API (python3/graphviz package required)
Use the "make indent" utility to auto indent API files (clang-format package required)
Use the "make clean" utility to clean cmake API build
Use the "make cleandoc" utility to clean documentation
Use the "make cleangraph" utility to clean API graph
Use the "make clear" utility to clean/cleandoc/cleangraph
Use the "make help" to get Makefile possible targets list
Use the "make uninstall" utility to uninstall API (Unix only)

Development:
============

Required/recommended package(s):
- clang-format (>= 11.0.0) (Auto indent C/C++/Objective-C code tool)
- doxygen (>=1.9.0) (Auto documentation generation tool)
- graphviz (>= 2.44.1) (Set of graph drawing tools)
- python3 (>= 3.6) (High-level programming language)
- valgrind (Memory debugging tool)

Add/modify a module:
- Read HOW-TO-DEV text file
- Refer to the models/ section if needed
- Add/enhance include/ and src/
- Add/enhance test/ section with new features, test retrocompatibility and memory leaks
- Auto indent with "make indent"
- Check updating documentation with "make doc"
- Write changes in CHANGELOG for future version

Improve a module:
- Check "// TODO" or "// WARN" markers regularly
