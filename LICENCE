The Do What The Fuck You Want To Public License (WTFPL) is a free software
license.

There is a long ongoing battle between GPL zealots and BSD fanatics, about
which license type is the most free of the two. In fact, both license types
have unacceptable obnoxious clauses (such as reproducing a huge disclaimer
that is written in all caps) that severely restrain our freedoms. The WTFPL
can solve this problem.

When analysing whether a license is free or not, you usually check that it
allows free usage, modification and redistribution. Then you check that the
additional restrictions do not impair fundamental freedoms. The WTFPL renders
this task trivial: it allows everything and has no additional restrictions.
How could life be easier? You just DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO.
